# Project Title
This is a simple website which is based on pure html and the name of the website is **The Little Taco Shop**.

# Project Description
 This project involves creating a website for a **Taco shop** in **Denmark**. This website helps the customers to find essential details about the taco shop regarding the **timings** and the **menu**. Most of the Html5 tags and elements have been used for creating this website. Comments have been added to for future developers to refer.

## Why Html only?
Recently I had learned Html from an online bootcamp and wanted to put that theoretical knowledge for some practical use and so I decided to use html only for creating this website. This way I was able to create this static website with no styling and only html.

## Things I learned
Through this project I was able to enhance my html skills and throughout the project I learned various new **Html5 tags** which I didn't knew earlier. Apart from that I was also got to use **github** which is an essential skill for all future developers. Importance of wrting comments and quality code were also some of the things I learned from building this project.

## Final Thoughts
This is my First project in my programming career that I have developed and pushed on github. I hope to make many other projects which will hopefully be **Dynamic** and will solve common problems of the people.
